## Canonical Core Chain

### 1) Algebraic foundation

- **Biquaternion algebra** ℂ⊗ℍ and its core structural properties  
  Source: `canonical/algebra/`

### 2) Fundamental field and complex time

- **Θ(q,τ)** as the fundamental field structure

- `canonical/gr_closure/gap_10t_palatini_torsion_dynamics.tex` — invertible 24-component Cartan torsion map and algebraic torsion elimination in the minimal first-order branch.
- `canonical/gr_closure/gap_10l_psi_symmetry_propagation.tex` — intrinsic Lorentz-slice involution, equivariant fixed-set propagation, and metric invariance under vertical Lorentz/translation-symmetric psi evolution.
- `canonical/gr_closure/gap_10i_augmented_holonomy.tex` — exact augmented-connection/holonomy existence criterion for prescribed `(E,A,B)`.

- `tools/verify_remaining_gr_subclosures.py` — exact Cartan rank, Lorentz involution, psi-gauge metric stability, and augmented-curvature checks.
- `tools/verify_canonical_spin_current.py` — direct fixed-background matter current, affine torsion no-go, Lorentz-invariant pairing classification, and the auxiliary affine-stationarity sample.
- `tools/verify_gradient_composite_flatness.py` — exact determinant identity and nonlinear pullback check supporting the exact-gradient flatness no-go.
- Closed/conditional/narrowed: GAP-10K; GAP-10Ω-KIN/GR; GAP-10I-PAIR-KIN and GAP-10I-PAIR-GR (torsion-free no-go), GAP-10I-TORSION-LOCAL (closed locally); GAP-10T-PALATINI and GAP-10T-SPIN (conditional), GAP-10T-FLAT-NOGO, GAP-10T-PAIRING-NOGO, and GAP-10T-GRADIENT-FLATNESS (no-go), with `GAP-10T-JET-AUX` closed, `GAP-10T-JET-CONSTRAINT-SELECTION` closed as a no-go, and full GAP-10T-DYN narrowed; GAP-10L-CONN and GAP-10L-SYM (conditional) with GAP-10L-DYN narrowed; GAP-10I-SR and GAP-10I-PRESCRIBED, GAP-10I-1S (no-go), GAP-10I-2S optional for torsion-free completion and GAP-10I-CURVED local kinematics closed with dynamics/global part narrowed; GAP-10D-PALATINI/UNIQUENESS, GAP-10D-A2-FORM and GAP-10D-SPECTRAL-IR (conditional), GAP-10D-UNDERDETERMINATION (no-go), with GAP-10D narrowed; GAP-10psi-KIN/SYM with GAP-10psi narrowed.
- Still open at full theory level: derivation of the constrained gauge-fixed Hessian and physical mode count, nonminimal curvature coupling, UV scale/regulator from the finalized Theta measure, a non-surjective tetrad-selection principle or induced collective-field construction, global/null-patch continuation, self-consistent curved on-shell selection, physical psi stability, GAP-B-MASTER, and GAP-U2Theta.
- The compact-ψ profile route remains noncanonical under the current Axiom C, but now has a local free-embedding completion candidate: `research_tracks/T1_GR/free_fiber_completion/gap_10r_free_fiber_embedding_completion.tex`. Its companion `gap_10s_covariant_profile_geometry.tex` supplies a flat pairing-compatible ambient derivative, proves induced Levi--Civita/Gauss geometry and preserves free rank under profile-frame changes. It also separates the central complex symmetric channel `gamma=g+ih` from the antisymmetric biquaternionic bivector. Profile selection, canonical connection notation, canonical-action origin, holomorphic/Jacobi restrictions, matter separation, and global completion remain open.

### 4) Gauge and interaction recovery

- SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) structural recovery tracks
- Chirality and QED-sector derivations where closed
- Explicit open gaps retained (e.g., unresolved Higgs/Yukawa closures)

Sources: `canonical/interactions/`, `canonical/su3_derivation/`, `canonical/chirality/`, `papers/UBT_Gauge_Submission.tex`

**Triqubit error-status closure (2026-07-26):**
- `canonical/interactions/gap_su3_triqubit_qec.tex` — exact projector proof that all single `X_i`/`Y_i` errors are leakage-detectable, compressed `Z_i` operators are non-scalar, and Knill--Laflamme fails for `{I,X_1,X_2,X_3}`.

SU(3) colour structure, C2-i CLOSED v55), unitarity deferred EW-2

## Open Derivation Gaps (Mandatory status discipline)

The following items are explicitly tracked as unresolved unless a full derivation
is added to canonical sources:

- Full UBT quantum field theory closure (Hilbert structure, Born rule,
  measurement map, path-integral closure): **OPEN_GAP**
- Born rule from UBT: **OPEN_GAP**
- Path-integral measure in biquaternionic coordinates: **OPEN_GAP**
- Renormalization group from UBT action: **OPEN_GAP**
- Weak interaction chirality/parity-violation derivation from geometry:
  **CONJECTURE / OPEN_GAP** until SU(2)\_L coupling and closure conditions are derived
- Anomalous magnetic moment prediction from UBT first principles: **OPEN_GAP**

Active scaffolds documenting these gaps:

- `src/ubt/quantum/quantum_scaffold.py`
- `src/ubt/solitons/regularization.py`
- `src/ubt/algebra/chirality.py`
- `src/ubt/observables/physics_observable_bridge.py`
- `docs/quantum_sector_status.md`
- `docs/observable_bridge.md`
- `research_tracks/renormalization/finite_energy_soliton_regularization.md`
- `research_tracks/weak_sector/chirality_and_parity_status.md`

## Research-Track (Non-canonical) Scientific Work

The following are scientific but not canonical closure claims:

- numerical diagnostics and reproducibility workflows,
- open alpha routes,
- CMB/Planck and related data-analysis tracks,
- prime-stability and lepton-spectrum active investigations,
- explicit conjectures and unresolved problems.

Primary location: `research_tracks/`

## Non-canonical speculative extensions

These extensions are not part of the canonical UBT derivation chain and are not established physical results.

Speculative material is maintained under `speculative_extensions/`, including
consciousness/psychons, ThetaComm-like narratives, afterlife/survival claims,
and metaphysical/simulation-style interpretations.

- `speculative_extensions/invisibility/SPHERICAL_TANGENTIAL_NULL_SHELL.md` —
  noncanonical spherical target: `gamma_AB=0` on the inner angular
  two-surface with a nonzero invariant biquaternionic area channel.
- `speculative_extensions/invisibility/WHITNEY_SPHERICAL_NULL_SHELL_THETA.md` —
  exact off-shell global `Theta` realiser and flat-exterior matching; the
  action, on-shell dynamics, stability, and zero exterior scattering remain
  open.
- `speculative_extensions/invisibility/POLYNOMIAL_ACTION_REGULARITY_AUDIT.md` —
  exact structural audit: a metric-free pure-Theta quartic four-form is
  regular at degeneracy but is a boundary term; non-topological shell
  selection remains open.
- `speculative_extensions/invisibility/HERMITIAN_SUPPORT_GRAM_ROUTE.md` —
  exact noncanonical kinematic result: the central-null Whitney sphere has a
  positive Hermitian support Gram and nonzero internal area/volume; covariant
  action promotion and stabilisation remain open.
- `speculative_extensions/invisibility/CLOCK_COMPENSATED_SUPPORT_GRAM.md` —
  exact conditional shell result: a `Theta`-only clock-mode compensator makes
  the positive support Gram invariant under standard local `SL(2,C)`
  congruence and yields `T_Theta=t`; projector uniqueness, full bimodule
  covariance, action selection, and stability remain open.
- `speculative_extensions/invisibility/PHASE_CHARGE_FINITE_SCALE_STABILIZATION.md` —
  exact reduced-model theorem: a conserved relative phase charge of the
  Whitney `psi=+/-1` block leaves the visible central metric null and gives a
  strict finite minimum of the internal support scale; master-action origin,
  radius locking, full stability, and zero scattering remain open.

### GEM compact modes and Gödel-type kinematic target (2026-07-25)

- `research_tracks/gem_compact_modes/gem_compact_modes.tex` —
  `GEM-CM-K1/K2` [L1]: exact averaged `(+n,-n)` current and compact-gradient
  identities; balanced current/flux vanish while gradient energy remains
  positive.
- Same note — `GEM-CM-GA1` [L1]: even-carrier/odd-lift grade audit; no
  independent odd field is added to canonical biquaternionic Theta.
- Same note — `GEM-CM-NG1` [L1]: common infinitesimal Lorentz rotor gives
  `delta g=0` and cannot be a physical light-cone response.
- `tools/verify_gem_compact_modes.py` — exact/numerical regression for compact
  modes, the Lorentz no-go, and the Gödel coframe kinematic target.
- Open: balanced non-zero bivector/spin polarization, canonical action source,
  symmetric metric strain, distinction from standard stress-energy, dynamical
  `R_psi`, Gödel-type solution, and global chronology.
- Historical imaginary-metric/CTC documents remain preserved under
  `speculative_extensions/`; see `research_tracks/gem_compact_modes/LEGACY_MAP.md`.

- `canonical/gr_closure/gap_10t_minimal_one_connection_gr_no_go.tex` — architecture-level exact-GR no-go and completion fork.
- `canonical/gr_closure/gap_10t_split_jet_right_inverse.tex` — explicit local composite Lorentz plus relative-central jet right inverse, keeping physical curvature Levi-Civita; kinematic closure only.
- `canonical/gr_closure/gap_10t_split_jet_auxiliary_completion.tex` — multiplier action, exact lambda=0 theorem, nonpropagation/on-shell decoupling, and surjective-selection no-go.
- `canonical/gr_closure/gap_10d_induced_gravity_endgame.tex` — axiomatic underdetermination theorem and corrected proper-time/Kaluza--Klein induced Einstein coefficient.
- `canonical/gr_closure/gap_10_gr_effective_completion.tex` — complete conditional effective GR branch through two derivatives.
- `tools/verify_gr_endgame_completion.py` — multiplier-rank, proper-time coefficient, self-dual KK constant, and Planck-ratio checks.
