## Derivation Route 1: ℤ₂×ℤ₂×ℤ₂ Involutions

### Setup

The biquaternion algebra `ℂ⊗ℍ` has a canonical involution structure.
Let `{1, i, j, k}` denote the standard quaternion basis.  Define three
independent ℝ-linear involutions:

```
α: q₀ + q₁i + q₂j + q₃k  ↦  q₀ - q₁i - q₂j + q₃k
β: q₀ + q₁i + q₂j + q₃k  ↦  q₀ - q₁i + q₂j - q₃k
γ: q₀ + q₁i + q₂j + q₃k  ↦  q₀ + q₁i - q₂j - q₃k
```

These generate a group `G := ⟨α,β,γ⟩ ≅ ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ × ℤ₂` of order 8.

### Theorem G.A: 𝔰𝔲(3) in ℂ⊗ℍ

**Claim**: The traceless anti-Hermitian elements of `ℂ⊗ℍ` that are
`G`-equivariant (transform consistently under all three involutions) form a
Lie algebra isomorphic to `𝔰𝔲(3)`.

**Proof strategy**:
1. Identify the 8-dimensional real subspace of `ℂ⊗ℍ` spanned by the Gell-Mann
   generators `λ₁,...,λ₈` in the `Mat(2,ℂ)` realisation.
2. Verify closure under commutator: `[λᵢ, λⱼ] = 2i fᵢⱼₖ λₖ` with
   the correct `f`-tensors.
3. Verify the involution covariance of each generator.

**Status**: PROVED [L0]  
**Source**: `canonical/su3_derivation/su3_from_involutions.tex`,
`canonical/su3_derivation/step3_SU3_result.tex`

### Theorem G.B: Fundamental representation

**Claim**: The fundamental `3` representation of `SU(3)_c` is realised on the
3-dimensional complex subspace of `ℂ⊗ℍ` selected by the ψ-winding modes.

**Status**: PROVED [L0]  
**Source**: `canonical/interactions/sm_gauge.tex` §Theorem G.B

### Theorem G.C: Adjoint representation

**Claim**: The 8 Gell-Mann generators `λᵢ` transform in the adjoint representation
`8` of `SU(3)_c` under the adjoint action `X ↦ UXU†` for `U ∈ SU(3)`.

**Numerical verification**: All 8 generators verified.  
**Status**: PROVED [L0]  
**Source**: `canonical/interactions/sm_gauge.tex` §Theorem G.C

### Theorem G.D: EW/strong decoupling

**Claim**: The decomposition of `ℂ⊗ℍ` into the SU(3) and SU(2)_L sectors is
orthogonal — the strong and electroweak gauge sectors decouple algebraically.

**Status**: PROVED [L0]  
**Source**: `canonical/interactions/sm_gauge.tex` §Theorem G.D

## Derivation Route 2: Qubit / Triqubit Encoding

A complementary representation-level realization of `su(3)` uses a qubit encoding:

```
ℂ⊗ℍ ≅ Mat(2,ℂ) ≅ (qubit algebra)
```

The canonical one-hot construction embeds the fundamental triplet in the
weight-1 sector and extends the action trivially on its five-dimensional
complement. A separate fermionic Fock construction acts naturally on all eight
states and yields `1⊕3⊕3bar⊕1`. Both algebras are verified, but they are not the
same eight-dimensional representation.

**Status**: REPRESENTATION VERIFIED; not an independent action-level derivation  
**Source**: `canonical/interactions/su3_qubit_encoding.tex`,
`canonical/bridges/su3_gauge_qubit_equivalence.tex`,
`research_tracks/su3_qubit_mapping/`

The bridge to Route 1 establishes equivalence on the selected fundamental
triplet carrier. It does not by itself show that UBT dynamics selects the
one-hot extension, the Fock extension, or local QCD gauge dynamics.

## Colour Confinement

### What is proved (structural argument)

From the `ℂ⊗ℍ` algebra:
- Free quarks are algebraically inadmissible (they do not correspond to
  gauge-invariant operators in the algebra).
- Hadrons satisfy the colour singlet condition `⟨C₂⟩ = 0` where `C₂` is
  the quadratic Casimir.

This is a **structural confinement argument** — not a dynamical proof.

### What is not proved (open)

A rigorous dynamical proof of confinement from the UBT field equations
(e.g., area law for Wilson loops, mass gap) has not been achieved.
This mirrors the status of confinement in standard QCD (Millennium Prize problem).

**Status**: Structural argument [L0] + experimental support (LHCb exotic hadron data
consistent); dynamical proof OPEN.

---

## Three Generations

The three-dimensional real imaginary-quaternion sector supplies three
independent candidate mode directions.  Identifying those directions with the
three observed Standard-Model generations, and selecting the physical
`ψ`-winding realization, requires additional model assumptions:

```
candidate directions:  dim_ℝ(Im ℍ) = 3
physical identification:  candidate directions ↔ three generations
```

Under that identification the copies carry the same gauge quantum numbers,
while their distinct mass scales remain an open dynamical problem (see
`T3_ALPHA/assumptions_audit.md`).  The dimension count is exact; the physical
generation assignment is not yet selected by the canonical action.

**Status**: DERIVED WITH ASSUMPTIONS (`CLAIMS.yaml: three_generations`)  
**Source**: `canonical/n_eff/`, `canonical/interactions/`; dynamical selection OPEN

## Open Problems Specific to SU(3) Sector

### OP-SU3-1: Strong coupling g_s

The strong coupling constant `g_s` (or equivalently `α_s = g_s²/(4π)`) has not
been derived from first principles in UBT.  Its running with the renormalisation
scale is not yet addressed.

**Required**: A derivation of `g_s` from the normalization of the SU(3) sector
action in `S_total[Θ]`.

### OP-SU3-2: Quark-hadron duality

The identification of specific biquaternion field configurations with the quark
and gluon content of specific hadrons has not been made.  The structural
confinement argument does not yet give the meson/baryon mass spectrum.

### OP-SU3-3: CP violation in strong sector

The `θ_QCD` parameter (strong CP problem) has not been addressed.  The UBT
complex-time sector (`τ = t + iψ`) may provide a geometric mechanism for CP
violation, but this has not been formalised.

## Summary for Paper Writing

The following elements are **ready to write up** for the SM gauge paper:

- [x] Biquaternion algebra isomorphism `ℂ⊗ℍ ≅ Mat(2,ℂ)` — [L0]
- [x] Involutions `ℤ₂×ℤ₂×ℤ₂` and `𝔰𝔲(3)` realisation — [L0]
- [x] Theorems G.A, G.B, G.C, G.D — all [L0] proved
- [x] Qubit carrier and `su(3)` algebra confirmation — representation level
- [x] Structural confinement argument — [L0]
- [x] Three candidate generation directions from `ψ`/`Im ℍ` structure — derived with assumptions
- [ ] Strong coupling `g_s` — to be stated as open
- [ ] CP violation / strong CP — to be stated as open
- [ ] Quark-hadron duality / spectrum — to be stated as open

A representation-focused note is ready. A paper claiming a full physical
derivation of QCD still requires action-level gauge dynamics, matter-field
identification, coupling normalization and a consistent choice of the 8D
qubit extension.
