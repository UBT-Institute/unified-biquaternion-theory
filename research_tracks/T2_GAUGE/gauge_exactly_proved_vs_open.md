## Legend

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **[L0]** | Algebraic identity — follows from the definition of ℂ⊗ℍ alone |
| **[L1]** | Proved theorem — requires axioms A, B, F plus standard mathematics |
| **[SE]** | Semi-empirical — value or structure fixed by experiment |
| **[MC]** | Motivated conjecture — physically/algebraically motivated, not proved |
| **[OPEN]** | Open — no proof exists; no obstruction fully characterised |
| **[OPEN-HRD]** | Open hard — resisted many approaches; requires new mathematics |

## 10. Gauge Sector Paper Readiness

### Statements that can be made in a journal paper without further work

**Zero-free-parameter results [L0]:**
1. ℂ⊗ℍ ≅ Mat(2,ℂ) — the algebraic foundation
2. 𝔰𝔲(3) realised in ℂ⊗ℍ (Theorems G.A–G.D) — four theorems
3. Quarks in **3**, gluons in **8** — confirmed numerically
4. SU(2)_L from left norm-preserving action
5. U(1)_Y from right scalar phase action
6. U(1)_EM from ψ-cycle phase
7. Three generations from dim_ℝ(Im ℍ) = 3
8. Structural colour confinement

**To be stated as open or semi-empirical:**
- Chirality (SU(2)_L not SU(2)_R): motivated, Gap C1
- Weinberg angle θ_W: semi-empirical; Gap EW-1 (new priority — see `weinberg_angle_derivation.md`)
- Higgs mechanism / gauge boson masses: open
- Fermion masses: open hard
- g_s, α_s running: open

### Impact statement

No other published framework derives all three Standard Model gauge factors from a
**single 8-dimensional real algebra** without introducing the gauge group as external
input.  The SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) structure, three generations, structural confinement,
and charge quantisation all emerge from zero free parameters within ℂ⊗ℍ.
