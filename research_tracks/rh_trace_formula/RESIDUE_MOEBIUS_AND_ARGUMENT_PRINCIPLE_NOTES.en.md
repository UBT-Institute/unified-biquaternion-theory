# Residues, the argument principle, and the Möbius route to RH

**Date:** 2026-08-25  
**Status:** working mathematical synthesis; no proof of the Riemann hypothesis and no upgrade of any UBT claim.  
**Scope:** classical analytic number theory plus an explicit interface to the current UBT theta–Mellin/RH working route.

<a id="scope-and-notation"></a>
## 0. Scope and notation

Write

\[
\zeta(s)=\sum_{n\ge 1}n^{-s}=\prod_p(1-p^{-s})^{-1},
\qquad \Re s>1,
\]

and let \(\mu\) be the Möbius function, \(\Lambda\) the von Mangoldt function, and

\[
M(x):=\sum_{n\le x}\mu(n)
\]

the Mertens summatory function. Unless analytic continuation is stated explicitly, series and Euler-product manipulations are made first in their half-plane of absolute convergence.

The four parts below separate established mathematics from the UBT-specific bridge. The conclusions are deliberately negative where a proposed shortcut is insufficient.

<a id="part-a"></a>
## A. Residues and holomorphicity

<a id="a1-local-data"></a>
### A.1 Local meromorphic data

The zeta function has a simple pole at \(s=1\) with residue \(1\). If \(\rho\) is a zero of multiplicity \(m_\rho\), then locally

\[
\zeta(s)=(s-\rho)^{m_\rho}g(s),\qquad g(\rho)\ne0.
\]

Consequently,

\[
\operatorname*{Res}_{s=\rho}\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}=m_\rho,
\qquad
\operatorname*{Res}_{s=\rho}\left(-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)=-m_\rho,
\]

whereas at the pole \(s=1\),

\[
\operatorname*{Res}_{s=1}\left(-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)=1.
\]

Thus \(-\zeta'/\zeta\) records zeros with negative multiplicity and the pole of \(\zeta\) with positive multiplicity. The reciprocal \(1/\zeta\) has a zero at \(s=1\) and poles exactly at the zeros of \(\zeta\), with matching orders.

<a id="a2-rh-holomorphicity"></a>
### A.2 The zero-free formulation of RH

Using the functional equation and the known location of the trivial zeros, RH is equivalent to the statement that \(\zeta(s)\ne0\) for \(\Re s>1/2\). Equivalently,

\[
\boxed{\;1/\zeta\in\mathcal O\!\left(\{s\in\mathbb C:\Re s>1/2\}\right).\;}
\]

The point \(s=1\) causes no exception because \(1/\zeta\) has a zero there. This equivalence does not say that the Dirichlet series \(\sum\mu(n)n^{-s}\) already converges throughout that half-plane; extending that series requires estimates on its partial sums.

<a id="part-b"></a>
## B. Argument principle and winding number

<a id="b1-principle"></a>
### B.1 Exact counting statement

Let \(f\) be meromorphic inside and on a positively oriented contour \(C\), with no zeros or poles on \(C\). Then

\[
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_C\frac{f'(s)}{f(s)}\,ds
=N_Z(C)-N_P(C),
\]

where zeros and poles are counted with multiplicity. The same integer is the winding number of the closed curve \(f(C)\) about the origin:

\[
\operatorname{wind}(f(C),0)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\Delta_C\arg f.
\]

For \(f=\zeta\), a contour enclosing \(s=1\) returns the number of enclosed zeta zeros minus one. For the completed entire xi function

\[
\xi(s)=\frac12s(s-1)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\zeta(s),
\]

the same integral counts nontrivial zeros without a pole subtraction.

<a id="b2-what-winding-cannot-do"></a>
### B.2 What winding does not prove

The argument principle counts zeros in a region; it does not, by itself, force them onto its symmetry axis. A contour split around the critical line can prove RH only if an additional estimate shows zero count zero in \(\Re s>1/2\), or if another theorem forces all counted zeros to lie on \(\Re s=1/2\). Functional-equation symmetry alone permits pairs \(\rho\) and \(1-\rho\) off the line.

Therefore a UBT winding or phase construction must supply a new analytic ingredient—such as positivity, monotonicity, a zero-free estimate, or a genuinely self-adjoint spectral identification—not merely reproduce the classical counting integral.

<a id="part-c"></a>
## C. Möbius/Mertens equivalence and the Dirichlet-algebra bridge

<a id="c1-dirichlet-series"></a>
### C.1 Reciprocal zeta and partial summation

Absolute convergence for \(\Re s>1\) gives

\[
\frac1{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}.
\]

Abel partial summation yields, initially for \(\Re s>1\),

\[
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}
=s\int_1^\infty M(x)x^{-s-1}\,dx,
\]

provided the boundary term \(M(X)X^{-s}\) tends to zero. More precisely, at finite \(X\),

\[
\sum_{n\le X}\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}
=M(X)X^{-s}+s\int_1^X M(x)x^{-s-1}\,dx.
\]

The classical Mertens formulation is

\[
\boxed{\;\mathrm{RH}\iff
(\forall\varepsilon>0)\quad
M(x)=O_\varepsilon\!\left(x^{1/2+\varepsilon}\right).\;}
\]

The forward and reverse implications use analytic continuation and standard contour/Perron arguments; the displayed integral explains the exponent threshold but is not, alone, a complete proof of both directions.

<a id="c2-formal-dirichlet-algebra"></a>
### C.2 Formal operator notation

Introduce formal basis elements \(D_n\) with

\[
D_mD_n=D_{mn},\qquad D_1=1.
\]

Multiplication of coefficient series is then Dirichlet convolution. In the completed formal Dirichlet algebra, where every coefficient receives only finitely many divisor contributions, define

\[
\mathcal Z:=\sum_{n\ge1}D_n.
\]

Since \(1*\mu=\varepsilon\),

\[
\boxed{\;\mathcal Z^{-1}=\sum_{n\ge1}\mu(n)D_n.\;}
\]

Let the derivation \(\delta\) be defined by \(\delta D_n=(\log n)D_n\). Then

\[
\mathcal Z^{-1}\delta\mathcal Z
=\sum_{n\ge1}(\mu*\log)(n)D_n
=\sum_{n\ge1}\Lambda(n)D_n,
\]

because

\[
\boxed{\;\Lambda=\mu*\log.\;}
\]

Under the Mellin character \(D_n\mapsto n^{-s}\), valid analytically for \(\Re s>1\), these formal identities become

\[
\mathcal Z\mapsto\zeta(s),\qquad
\delta\mathcal Z\mapsto-\zeta'(s),\qquad
\mathcal Z^{-1}\delta\mathcal Z\mapsto-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}
=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}.
\]

The inverse above is a formal Dirichlet-convolution inverse. It is not automatically an inverse of a bounded operator on a UBT Hilbert space. Any operator interpretation must separately specify the space, domain, closure, convergence, and spectrum.

<a id="part-d"></a>
## D. Relation to the current UBT RH/theta–Mellin route

<a id="d1-variable-map"></a>
### D.1 Exact variable map

The current reduced bridge uses

\[
S(t,\psi)=\sum_{n\ge1}a_ne^{-\pi\psi n^2}e^{i\pi t n^2}
\]

and, at \(t=0\) with unit weights,

\[
\int_0^\infty \psi^{w-1}S(0,\psi)\,d\psi
=\Gamma(w)\pi^{-w}\zeta(2w).
\]

Hence the classical zeta variable in Parts A–C is

\[
s=2w.
\]

The RH critical line \(\Re s=1/2\) therefore maps to \(\Re w=1/4\), not \(\Re w=1/2\). Likewise,

\[
-\frac{d}{dw}\log\zeta(2w)
=-2\frac{\zeta'(2w)}{\zeta(2w)}
=2\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{2w}},
\qquad \Re w>1/2.
\]

If the prime-power series is written without the factor \(2\), the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the zeta argument \(s=2w\), not differentiation with respect to \(w\).

<a id="d2-why-ubt-rh"></a>
### D.2 Why RH is relevant to UBT

UBT meets RH for a precise structural reason, not because biquaternions or complex time automatically imply a statement about zeta zeros. Canonical UBT starts from \(\Theta(q,\tau)\) with \(\tau=t+i\psi\). The current reduced bridge isolates a quadratic \(\psi\)-damped sector, whose heat kernel is a theta series. Its Mellin transform is exactly

\[
\Theta(q,\tau)
\rightsquigarrow S(0,\psi)
\xrightarrow{\mathcal M_\psi}
\Gamma(w)\pi^{-w}\zeta(2w).
\]

The same zeta function has an Euler product and a logarithmic derivative with \(\Lambda(n)\) coefficients. Its zeros then govern the oscillatory corrections in the explicit formulas for prime counting. A zero

\[
\rho=\beta+i\gamma
\]

contributes terms with the scale/frequency form

\[
x^\rho=x^\beta e^{i\gamma\log x}.
\]

RH states that every nontrivial contribution has the same square-root amplitude exponent \(\beta=1/2\); only its logarithmic frequency \(\gamma\) varies. An off-line zero would produce a different power-law amplitude and, by functional-equation symmetry, a partner at \(1-\beta\). RH is therefore the sharp cancellation/stability boundary for the multiplicative arithmetic sector reached by this theta–Mellin bridge.

The possible UBT significance is consequently threefold:

1. complex-time evolution supplies the heat/theta side of the bridge;
2. Mellin transformation supplies the arithmetic zeta and prime-power side;
3. a future UBT-derived self-adjoint operator, determinant, positivity identity, or Möbius cancellation law could turn the location of zeta zeros into an internal spectral-consistency condition.

At present only the first two items exist in the reduced bridge mathematics. Canonical UBT has not yet derived the required theta propagator or arithmetic operator from its action. UBT therefore does not currently depend on RH for its canonical validity, and RH does not follow from UBT. The connection identifies a concrete research interface and the missing theorem that would make it physical rather than inserted.

<a id="d3-admissible-bridge"></a>
### D.3 What would constitute a noncircular UBT bridge

The identities above suggest two precise, non-equivalent targets:

1. derive from canonical UBT dynamics an object whose Dirichlet coefficients are \(\mu(n)\), then prove the bound \(M(x)=O_\varepsilon(x^{1/2+\varepsilon})\); or
2. derive an operator or determinant whose logarithmic derivative has \(\Lambda(n)\) coefficients and whose analyticity, positivity, or self-adjointness excludes zeros in \(\Re s>1/2\).

Defining the formal \(D_n\) algebra, inserting \(\mu\) or \(\Lambda\) by hand, or applying Mellin inversion to a known zeta identity is not a UBT derivation. The coefficients must arise from the canonical action, a proved theta/revival mechanism, or a derived trace/orbit structure without using zeta zeros as input.

<a id="d4-current-verdict"></a>
### D.4 Current verdict and open gap

The residue, winding, Möbius, Mertens, and logarithmic-derivative statements are established classical mathematics. They sharpen the target but do not close the current UBT gaps `GAP-THETA-PROP` and `GAP-THETA-PRIME-1`.

**GAP-RH-MOEBIUS-UBT:** derive, from the canonical UBT field equations or action, a non-post-selected mechanism producing the Möbius cancellation bound or an equivalent zero-free/spectral statement. Until this gap is closed, the route is a research programme, not a proof of RH.
