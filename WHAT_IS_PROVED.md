## 2026-07-27 update — canonical generalized-Dirac lift

| # | Claim | Level | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| GR-D1 | The canonical Lorentz-slice relation has an injective block lift `C(E)` satisfying `1/2{C(E),C(F)}=H_L(E,F)I_4` | [L0] | `canonical/geometry/biquaternion_dirac_lift.tex`; `tools/verify_canonical_relation_dirac_lift.py` |
| GR-D2 | With `Gamma_mu=C(E_mu)`, the canonical metric identity is exactly equivalent to the curved Clifford relation `1/2{Gamma_mu,Gamma_nu}=g_mu_nu I_4` | [L0] | same |
| GR-D3 | For every nondegenerate tetrad, `D_e g` is surjective of rank 10; its complete kernel is the six-dimensional Lorentz Lie algebra | [L1] | same; `canonical/gr_closure/covariant_tetrad_rank_theorem.tex` |
| GR-D4 | `Gamma_*=diag(I_2,-I_2)` anticommutes with every lifted `Gamma_mu`; `Gamma_*` and `i_c Gamma_*` give exact fifth channels of square `+I` and `-I` | [L0] | same |
| GR-D5 | The four-channel principal symbol squares to `g^{mu nu} xi_mu xi_nu I_4`, its determinant is the square of the metric quadratic form, and the fifth channel gives the exact extension `g^{-1}(xi,xi)+epsilon xi_psi^2` | [L0] | same; exact verifier |
| GR-D6 | If the generalized equation is in an independent `psi`-normal form, the invertible fifth channel uniquely solves for `D_psi Psi`, so the pointwise equation does not restrict the four spacetime tetrad slots and preserves rank 10 | [L0-C] | same; conditional on independent `D_psi` |
| GR-D7 | For a real eight-component constraint `F(Psi,e)=0`, the exact constrained metric rank is `dim(A+K)-6`, where `A={de:F_e de in im F_Psi}` and `K=ker D_e g`; full rank ten is equivalent to `A+K=R^16` | [L1] | `canonical/geometry/biquaternion_dirac_lift.tex`; `research_tracks/canonical_relation_generalized_dirac/no_extra_variable_rank_theorem.tex`; `tools/verify_no_extra_variable_rank.py` |
| GR-D8 | If the equation Jacobian with respect to the value of the original field, `F_Psi`, is invertible, every tetrad variation is admissible and the pointwise first-jet metric rank remains ten without any added field | [L1-C] | same |
| GR-D9 | A nonzero scalar block `M=mI_4`, or scalar-pseudoscalar block `M=m_sI_4+i m_p Gamma_*` with `(m_s,m_p)!=(0,0)`, is an explicit sufficient realization of invertible `F_Psi`, including after strict holomorphy | [L1-C] | same; derivation from the canonical action remains open |
| GR-D10 | If `F_Psi=0` and the first-order equation imposes eight independent real constraints only on the tetrad, the constrained metric rank is at most eight | [L1] | same |
| GR-D11 | Derivation of the required zero-order block/transversality from one UBT action, local PDE existence/integrability, Lorentz-slice preservation and Einstein/quantum dynamics | [OPEN] | `research_tracks/canonical_relation_generalized_dirac/PROOF_STATUS.md` |

The historical spinor-current tetrad rank calculations are valid only for that
alternative map and are not part of canonical UBT closure.

## 2026-07-26 GR endgame update — auxiliary jet and induced coefficient

- **GAP-10T-JET-AUX — CLOSED [L1]:** the split-jet multiplier action enforces the right-inverse constraint; variation of the Lorentz jet tensor and relative-central one-form forces the multiplier to vanish on every non-null patch. The jet sector is algebraic, nonpropagating, and has no on-shell metric or spin source.
- **GAP-10T-JET-CONSTRAINT-SELECTION — CLOSED AS NO-GO [L1]:** because the right inverse is surjective for every non-null `X`, the pure constraint is solved with zero action for every tetrad and cannot select `E[Theta]`.
- **GAP-10T-JET-DYN — NARROWED:** nonpropagation is closed; the origin of a separate metric effective action/non-surjective selector, null-patch continuation, and the constrained quantum measure remain.
- **GAP-10D-UNDERDETERMINATION — CLOSED AS NO-GO [L1]:** all current kinematic axioms are compatible with an arbitrary coefficient multiplying `integral sqrt(g) R`; they cannot determine Newton's constant.
- **GAP-10D-A2-FORM — CLOSED CONDITIONALLY [L1]:** a specified gauge-fixed Laplace-type Theta Hessian generates the Einstein term with `1/G_ind = N_B(1-6 xi) I_1/(12 pi)`, where `I_1` is the exact compact-psi proper-time KK integral.
- **GAP-10D-SPECTRAL-IR — CLOSED CONDITIONALLY [L1]:** together with the nonpropagating split-jet auxiliary sector, the induced two-derivative action gives a complete conditional effective GR branch with generic local Levi-Civita curvature.
- **GAP-10D — NARROWED:** the finalized UBT measure still must derive the physical mode count `N_B`, nonminimal coupling `xi`, UV identification and regulator/renormalisation prescription without fitting `G`.

## Track T1_GR: General Relativity Recovery

The authoritative local route is the projection-free covariant tetrad
\(E_\mu=\mathcal N_0^{-1/2}D_\mu\Theta\).  Historical metric, fiber, FRW,
and Schwarzschild ansätze are not promoted to current canonical proofs until
they are rederived in this route.

| α22 | Algebraic rewriting [OBS]: $B_{\mathrm{cand}} = 12^{3/2}\cdot 2^{1/8}\cdot\vartheta_3(0\|i)^{1/4} \approx 46.281$ — numerical accuracy $0.0066\%$; **not a first-principles derivation** | [OBS] | `research_tracks/T3_ALPHA/rogers_ramanujan_c3_connection.tex` |

The algebraic rewriting sharpens Gap G137-B: it makes explicit that the three
factors in the candidate $B$-formula have different physical origins (algebraic
structure, self-dual normalisation, winding partition function) and must each
be derived from $S[\Theta]$ separately.

## Minimal one-connection GR architecture

**GAP-10T-MINIMAL-ONE-CONNECTION-GR — CLOSED AS NO-GO [L1].** If the same metric-compatible Lorentz connection both
defines `E_mu=N0^(-1/2)D_mu Theta` and is the physical spacetime connection,
then the torsion-free branch has the concurrent-vector restriction and is not
generic GR. The local construction that represents an arbitrary tetrad uses
nonzero contortion and therefore makes that same physical connection
torsionful. Thus exact generic torsion-free GR plus universal local
single-Theta representability requires a distinct nonpropagating jet
connection (or abandonment of exact GR in favour of a torsionful theory).

**GAP-10T-JET-KIN — CLOSED LOCALLY [L1].** The exact-GR split architecture
has an explicit local right inverse: the component of
`sE-D_LC X` parallel to non-null `X` is supplied by a composite relative
central jet one-form, and the orthogonal component by a composite Lorentz jet
tensor. The physical connection remains Levi-Civita, so arbitrary GR curvature
is kinematically representable.

This does **not** complete the GR derivation. `GAP-10T-JET-DYN` (action-level
tetrad/jet selection and nonpropagation) and the Hilbert-Palatini curvature term
with its coefficient still require canonical derivations.
