# gauge_truth_matrix.md — Brutally Honest Gauge Sector Truth Matrix

**Author**: Ing. David Jaroš  
**Date**: 2026-04-28  
**Track**: T2_GAUGE — Standard Model Gauge Structure  
**Purpose**: Coldly accurate map of what is algebra, what is physics, what is
proved, what is open, what is speculative, and what is dead.
No hype.  Source: `reports/gauge_status_matrix.md` (detailed proof-level source).

## Reading This Document

This is the hostile-reviewer view of the gauge sector.  Every claim is
classified as either:

- **✅ PROVED** — formal theorem or algebraic identity; no free parameters
- **⚠️ CONDITIONAL** — proved if a named gap is solved
- **🔲 OPEN** — no proof; actively researched
- **🔴 DEAD END** — approach proved to fail; closed
- **🔵 DEFERRED** — out of scope for current paper; acknowledged

The column "Can claim in T2 paper?" answers: can this be stated as a theorem
(T), a motivated result (M), an open problem (O), or should it not be mentioned (X)?

properties are not proved — they involve the Clay Millennium mass-gap problem.
Do not conflate structural with dynamical confinement in the paper.

| **Weinberg angle sin²θ_W ≈ 0.231 from UBT (pure algebra)** | 🔴 **DEAD END** | Algebra alone cannot fix g/g'; no-go still stands | **O (explicit dead-end §6)** |
| EW1+RG conditional route (generator norms + one-loop running) | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | Gives $\sin^2\theta_W(\mathrm{GUT})=3/8$ and $\sin^2\theta_W(M_Z)\approx0.231$ only if Gap C2 Step 1 closes and full $Y_i$ are first-principles [L1]; see `research_tracks/EW/weinberg_angle_ew1_rg.tex` | O |

| Higgs doublet from S[Θ] (Gap EW-2) | 🔲 OPEN | Θ₀ VEV as doublet unproved | O |

### Dead-End Statement for Paper (copy into §6)

> **Gap EW (dead end)**: The biquaternion algebra $\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}$
> contains both SU(2)_L and U(1)_Y as subgroups, but does not fix the ratio
> $g'/g = \tan\theta_W$ of their coupling constants.  The two couplings $g$
> and $g'$ appear as independent parameters in any Lagrangian on
> $\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}$.  No purely algebraic argument has been found
> to enforce $\sin^2\theta_W = 0.231$, and a no-go argument suggests none exists:
> the algebra admits continuous deformations of the SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y embedding
> that change $\tan\theta_W$ continuously.  The Weinberg angle is therefore
> a semi-empirical input in UBT at this stage.

## 11. Quantitative Gap Summary

### Chirality Gap

| Dynamical exclusion of SU(2)_R | [MC] — motivated | C1b | 4–6 |

### Anomaly Gap

| What is needed | Current status | Gap | Weeks to close |
|----------------|---------------|-----|----------------|
| All SM gauge anomalies cancelled | [MC] conditional | Verify UV completion | 4–8 |
| Anomaly cancellation proved from UBT algebra | [OPEN] | Hard — fermion assignments missing | >12 |

|----------------|---------------|-----|
| Higgs mechanism for W/Z masses | [OPEN] | EW-2 |
| Yukawa couplings | [OPEN] | Y2 |

## 12. T2_GAUGE Paper Readiness

### What can be stated as theorems (zero new work needed)

1. ℂ⊗ℍ ≅ Mat(2,ℂ) — algebraic foundation
2. 𝔰𝔲(3) via ℤ₂×ℤ₂×ℤ₂ (Theorems G.A–G.D)
3. Quarks in **3**, gluons in **8**, EW/strong decoupling
4. Triqubit confirmation of SU(3)
5. Structural colour confinement
6. SU(2)_L from left norm-preserving action
7. U(1)_Y from right scalar phase
8. U(1)_EM from ψ-cycle phase
9. Three generations from ψ-winding modes
10. Hypercharge quantisation from Dirac condition
11. SU(2)_L chirality (left-chiral coupling, Gap C1 resolved)

### What must be stated as open or dead-end

| Result | Honest statement in paper |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Weinberg angle θ_W | **Dead end for pure algebra; conditional EW1+RG route exists pending Gap C2 Step 1** |
| W/Z masses from SSB | Defer to Higgs paper |
| Fermion masses | Defer; note KK-mismatch theorem |
| Dynamical confinement | Clay Millennium problem |
| Strong coupling g_s | Open problem |
| Anomaly cancellation from first principles | Open — requires fermion hypercharge assignments |

## 13. Overall T2_GAUGE Verdict

**Readiness without chirality C1b**: 80%  
**Readiness with C1b closed**: 88%  
**Readiness with anomaly check**: 90%  
**Readiness with EW/Higgs gaps**: Not in scope for T2 paper (deferred)

**Submission verdict**: T2_GAUGE is submittable now with honest dead-end
statements on Weinberg angle and deferred statements on Higgs/Yukawa.
The algebraic SU(3) × SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y emergence result is strong.
